# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `#`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey is to understand why employees at the tech company are leaving their entry level positions. My survey aims to identify key factors affecting employee satisfaction and to gather suggestions on what changes could improve retention.

```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target population: all current and recently departed employees in entry level positions at the tech company.

Sampling frame: a list of current employees in entry level positions, plus contact information for employees who left in the past six months.

Sampling units: individual employees (current and recent past employees).

Overall sampling strategy: I will use stratified random sampling. I will divide the population into two strata; current employees and recent past employees, and randomly select participants from each stratum to ensure both groups are represented.

Observational units: individual responses from each employee selected.

```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. How long were you employed in your most recent position here?  
   (Less than 6 months / 6–12 months / 1–2 years / More than 2 years)

2. What was your main reason for choosing to work at this company?  
   (Career growth / Pay and benefits / Company reputation / Flexible work schedule / Other)

3. On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied were you with your job overall?  
   (1 = Very dissatisfied, 5 = Very satisfied)

4. Which of the following influenced your satisfaction the most?  
   (Workload / Pay and benefits / Work-life balance / Manager support / Career development / Company culture)

5. Did you feel you received adequate training and support to do your job?  
   (Yes / No / Somewhat)

6. How well did your manager communicate expectations and feedback?  
   (Poor / Fair / Good / Very good / Excellent)

7. What changes would make you more likely to stay at this company longer?  
   (Open-ended text response)

8. What was your level of stress related to your work here?  
   (Low / Moderate / High / Very high)

9. Would you recommend this workplace to others?  
   (Yes / No / Unsure)

10. Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience?  
   (Open-ended text response)

```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type:
the General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering and Participating (GSS GVP) uses a probability-based, cross-sectional sample survey design. Data are collected from individuals at one point in time to represent the Canadian population aged 15 and over living in private households.

2. Sample size:
a field sample of approximately 50,000 units was used. About 40,000 households were invited to participate, and approximately 24,000 completed questionnaires were expected.

3. Target population :
the target population includes all persons aged 15 years and older living in private households in the ten provinces of Canada. Full-time residents of institutions (living there more than six months) are excluded.

4. Sampling frame: 
the sampling frame combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and administrative sources with Statistics Canada’s dwelling frame. Records consist of groups of telephone numbers associated with the same address, or a single number if no address link was available.

5. Survey mode :
data were collected directly from respondents using either an electronic self-completed questionnaire or computer-assisted telephone interviewing . Proxy responses were not permitted, and respondents could complete the survey in English or French.

6. Timeline:
Data collection took place from September 4, 2018 to December 28, 2018. The reference period for most questions was the 12 months preceding the interview date. The data were released on January 26, 2021.

7. Response rate:  
the overall response rate for the 2018 GSS GVP was 41.9%.

8. Weights :
survey weights were created so that each respondent represents multiple individuals in the population. The main person-level weight is WGHT_PER. Adjustments were made for non-response and for the rejective sampling design. Bootstrap weights were also created to support variance estimation.

9. Data processing:  
data processing followed Statistics Canada’s standardized SSPE processing framework. Automated and manual edits were applied throughout data collection and procesing to ensure logical consistency, correct flows and valid ranges.

10. Cleaning, imputation, etc.  
Missing data were handled primarily through donor imputation, where responses from similar respondents were used to fill in missing values. Mean imputation was used when donor imputation was not possible. Income variables were largely obtained through linkage to tax records, with remaining missing values imputed.

11. Sources of error  
sources of error include sampling error, non-response erro, coverage error, response error, and processing error. Sampling variability was estimated using bootstrap methods. Non-sampling errors were addresed through survey design, weighting and quality control procedures.

12. Limitations, known biases, etc.  
key limitations include exclusion of people living in institutions and households without telephone access. Despite weighting adjustmens, non-response bias may still exist. Mode effects may also occur due to differences between telephone and online responses.
